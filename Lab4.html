My name is Lawrence Sammour, I was born on May 2, 2002, in Hayward, California.
I am the grandson of the professional wrestler Peter "High Chief"
Fanene Maivia and son of the wrestler Rocky Johnson. I grew up watching 
my father perform in the ring With no plans to follow in his footsteps. But after a while
I started fantasizing about being a football player. I studied in Miami senior high
school and got the highest grades among my classmates. I graduated in on the 5th 
of june in 2020. I then lived in New york for a while before moving back to florida.

After high school I didn't have any plans. I visited different uniersities
but none were interesting to meI then found out that the university of miami 
was offering a football scholarship for students to enrollin the software 
engineering department. I was the lead football player in my highschool, that's 
why I appliedto the scholarship and got it. I started playing for the 
unniversitiesteam and enrolled in the software engineering department My 
university was built in the 1980s and had the program since the 1990s. I 
took courses like web development, Data structure and deep learning.
